                        <h3>Lack of Indianness in education</h3>
                        <p>Mahamana had unshakable faith in Hindu culture and wanted to propagate its best ideas and values . He had seen India's cultural heritage , drawn inspiration from its glorious traditions and tried to instill determination , self-confidence , self-respect and love for Indianness in the Indian psyche . He wanted to build a national character by inculcating moral values ​​in the youth . Mahamana had found lack of Indianness in modern education , and he laid the foundation of Hindu University to fill this gap .</p>
                        <p>It is unfortunate that after independence this deficiency has increased even more . Moral values ​​have declined rapidly in the country . Our old beliefs are breaking down . In fact, the Mission was born to re-establish these Indian cultural values ​​and to realize the dreams of Mahamana .</p>
                        <h3>Inauguration and Registration</h3>

On this occasion , messages and articles were received from the Prime Minister , Defense Minister and Vice Chancellor of Hindu University for the souvenir published .</p>

                            students should study the ancient scriptures. He said that following his teachings is more important than
                            paying floral tribute to Mahamana. The Chairman of the session, Vice Chancellor Dr. Harinarayan, in his
                            powerful speech, called upon people to adopt Mahamana's fearlessness and patriotism from his life. He said

                            lifestyle and speed up the work of Loksangraha.
